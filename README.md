# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis (Excel)

---

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn data from the telecom domain to identify why customers leave and how churn impacts business revenue. The analysis is performed entirely using Microsoft Excel and focuses on transforming raw data into meaningful insights through structured analysis and visualization.

---

## Objective
The main goal of this project is to measure customer churn, identify high-risk customer segments, and quantify revenue loss. The dashboard helps stakeholders understand churn patterns and make data-driven retention decisions.

---

## Data & Preparation
The dataset contains 7,043 customer records with information on tenure, monthly charges, contract type, internet service, payment method, and churn status.  
Data cleaning involved removing duplicates, handling missing values, and converting data into Excel Tables for dynamic analysis.

---

## Analysis Approach
Helper columns such as **Churn_Flag**, **Tenure_Group**, **Charges_Category**, and **Payment_Type** were created to simplify analysis.  
PivotTables were used to calculate churn rate, churn count, and segment-wise trends across tenure, pricing, contracts, services, and payment behavior.

## Dashboard & KPIs
An interactive Excel dashboard was built with the following KPIs:
- Total Customers  
- Churned Customers  
- Churn Rate  
- Revenue Lost  

Slicers allow users to filter insights dynamically.
